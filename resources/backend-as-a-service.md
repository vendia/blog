      not just for mobile apps

      Have a data model in mind and need to turn it into a production business API that you can deploy across departments, regions, clouds, and partners?

      Buying databases and API services separately – and then plugging them together yourself is costly, error-prone, time-consuming, and requires a team. To make matters worse, the biggest weakness of API services today is that they can’t “remember” anything, which makes managing shared data even more difficult.

      **There’s a better way to backend. **[Vendia](https://vendia.net/) lets you turn a data model into a production-grade, fault-tolerant, scalable, cloud-hosted Smart API in under 10 minutes – with 100% of your database and file storage needs to be included – for no additional effort.

      Download the **Future of APIs** to learn more about the challenges of building modern backends with traditional APIs, and how to overcome them rapidly.
