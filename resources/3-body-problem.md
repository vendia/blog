      Dr. Tim Wagner, Vendia co-founder and the Father of Serverless,
      investigates the benefits and tensions between centralized IT, private
      ledgers, and public blockchains for application development. Instead of
      one winning technology, Wagner proposes that all three must work together
      for the best greenfield and brownfield business solutions and technical
      outcomes. 


      **This is a must-read for any CIO, CTO, cloud architect, and professional developer responsible for delivering reliable data-based solutions.**
