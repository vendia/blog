      How conventional IT, private ledgers, and public blockchains will work together to usher in the Web 3.0 era.


      **Synopsis** Tim Wagner investigates the relationship and tensions between centralized IT, private ledgers and public blockchains for application development. Instead of a 'winner' Wagner proposes that all three will need to work together for optimal business solutions and technical outcomes. 


      This is a must read for any CIO, CTO, cloud architect, and professional developers responsible for delivering reliable, data-based solutions.
