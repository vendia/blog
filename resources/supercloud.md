      # Understanding supercloud


      **In this white paper, we explore:**


      - Strategies for adopting a supercloud approach, its benefits, and its challenges.

      - Anti-patterns of multi-cloud, such as the modern Shadow IT problem of "accidental multi-cloud" and "commodity cloning".

      - When cloud vendor redundancy is required, and when and why it should be avoided.

      - How innovative vendors like Vendia and Snowflake are creating solutions that enable companies to create enterprise-grade solutions without the historical challenges of paying for on-prem data centers, managing servers, or learning Kubernetes.
