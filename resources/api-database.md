      # **There’s a better way to backend.**


      Buying databases and API services separately – and then plugging them together yourself — is costly, error-prone, time-consuming, and requires a team. To make matters worse, API services can’t “remember” anything, which makes managing shared data even more difficult.


      Learn more about the challenges of building modern data sharing solutions with traditional APIs, and discover how to overcome them rapidly with Vendia Share.


      **With Vendia Share, you can turn a data model into a production-grade, fault-tolerant, scalable, cloud-hosted "smart API" — and you can do it in under 10 minutes. Yes, 100% of your database and file storage can be included for no additional effort.**
