      # **The Future of APIs**


      **APIs and databases together at last, for next-gen multi-party data sharing**


      Buying databases and API services separately – and then plugging them together yourself is costly, error-prone, time-consuming, and requires a team. To make matters worse, the biggest weakness of API services today is that they can’t “remember” anything, which makes managing shared data even more difficult.


      There’s a better way to backend.[](https://vendia.net/)


      [Vendia](https://vendia.net/) lets you turn a data model into a production-grade, fault-tolerant, scalable, cloud-hosted Smart API in under 10 minutes – with 100% of your database and file storage needs to be included – for no additional effort.



      Download the **Future of APIs** to learn more about the challenges of building modern data-sharing solutions with traditional APIs, and how to overcome them rapidly.
