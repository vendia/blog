      Learn how to enable data sharing and collaboration by combining Snowflake and [Vendia Share](https://www.vendia.com/product) for a single source of truth, no matter how robust or complex your data network. Together, the two platforms build a bridge across operational and analytical data worlds for real-time data availability and accuracy.


      In this 30-minute webinar, you’ll learn how to


      ✅ Reduce the costs and pain of building and maintaining back-and-forth data integrations


      ✅ Eliminate the need to manually reconcile various data sets for a single version of the truth and easy, secure, compliant collaboration across teams, systems, and companies


      ✅ Unlock a world in which there is no division between data “producers” and “consumers”


      ✅ Achieve collaboration — with compliance and control — on operational data across parties outside your company walls
