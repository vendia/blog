      ### Blockchains, databases, and APIs can't cut it on their own...but,
      together, they will modernize data sharing.


      Blockchains weren't built to scale well. But when Dr. Tim Wagner, inventor of AWS Lambda, built one in the cloud with the latest serverless technologies, he created the first enterprise-ready blockchain.


      Join Peter Sbarski, AWS Serverless Hero, as he talks with Dr. Tim Wagner, co-founder of Vendia and inventor of AWS Lambda. They share their journeys and talk about why bringing blockchains, cloud databases, Serverless tech, and APIs together in one solution for real-time multi-party data sharing is possible â€” and absolutey right for this moment in time.
