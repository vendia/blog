      Blockchains weren't built to scale too well. But when Dr. Tim Wagner, inventor of AWS Lambda, built one in the cloud with the latest serverless technologies he created the first enterprise-ready blockchain.


      Blockchains, databases, and APIs can't cut it on their ownâ€”but together they will modernize data sharing.


      Join Dr. Tim Wagner, co-founder of Vendia, and Peter Sbarski, AWS Serverless Hero, as they talk about bringing blockchains, cloud databases, serverless, and APIs together in one solution.


      The result: the ability to share data across boundaries, in real-time.
