## Summary

Our design and engineering teams worked diligently on a node details view redesign, which we're excited to share with you today. You'll also see noticeable developer experience improvements on the smart contracts details and the smart contract edit views. 


## Node Details Redesign

Now you donâ€™t have to search hard to find the newly redesigned action buttons - `Entity Explorer`, `GraphQL Explorer`, `File Explorer`, and `Smart Contracts`. They are front and center, ready for use. The details such as the `GraphQL URL` and the `Graph API Key`  have moved below the action buttons and the other resource ARNs that used to be on this page have moved to the `Manage Node' > `Resources` tab.

## Smart Contracts Editor Enhancements

We added more information to the Smart Contracts details page, including the Vendia resource name of the smart contract. In addition, we've auto-formatted the input query and the output mutation.

Additionally, we are now auto-populating the query args based on the input query when invoking a smart contract. Previously, the `Input Query` Args was empty `{}`. The default value of inferred keys is set to `null`. You will replace `null` with a valid value.

The Smart Contracts `Edit` page now includes a formatted editor instead of a plain text box. We also added links to the docs in case you need a reference as you work on your first Vendia Share smart contract.
