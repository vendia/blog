Vendia strives to continuously improve our product. Here are some recently improved functionalities.

## Tightened Security

Though our customers do not see this kind of update themselves, Vendia still tirelessly work on these security related updates to ensure our customer's data security.
In our recent updates, we reduced the DynamoDB permission of the consensus function to allow only the tables they have to. This is a general best practice for access control: Grant minimal needed access and no more.

## Less Timeouts
Some might have experienced timeouts when creating new nodes when inviting new participants in their Uni. We have improved our algorithm and mitigated chances of node creation timeouts.
