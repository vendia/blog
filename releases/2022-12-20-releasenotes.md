Vendia strives to continuously improve our product. Here are some of the latest updates.

## Tightened Security

Security is always top of mind at Vendia. 
In our latest update, further restrictions were added to the underlying services to reduce access to a more narrow set of needs. This follows a general best practice for access control: Grant only minimal needed access and no more.


## Less Timeouts
Some might have experienced timeouts while creating new nodes when inviting new participants. With an improved algorithm, we have mitigated chances of timeouts when creating a new node.
