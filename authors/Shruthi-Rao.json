    "short": "Vendia Co-Founder and CBO",
    "long": "Shruthi has been at the crux of innovation in multiple industries throughout her career, which served as a starting point to customer empathy. At AWS, Shruthi led over 1,000 customer conversations to solve the multi-party and cross-cloud data and code aggregation problem using Blockchains. She quickly realized that legacy blockchains were not suitable due to their high cost, low scalability, and complex enterprise integrations. Shruthi is a first generation Indian immigrant, mother to a 5 year old boy and frequently speaks at various conferences."
