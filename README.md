## How to contribute content

### TDLR;

1. Generate a new post file with `npm run new`
2. Write your markdown
3. Commit to the repo

### 1. Write your content in markdown!

New to markdown? [Read this](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Checkout the [markdown styleguide](https://github.com/vendia/blog/blob/master/posts/typography.mdx) for examples on how to format things.

---

### 2. Name your post file name

Blog posts need to be titled with a date prefix. This helps us keep the content nice and organized here in git.

Make sure to prefix post titles with the year, month and date in this format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

**Example:**

`YYYY-MM-DD-blog-post-name.md` :point_right: `2016-01-27-post-title-here.md`

Here is a [handy tool for slugifying blog post titles](https://blog.tersmitten.nl/slugify/)

---

### 3. In your post, include post meta information:

Include the post metadata at the top:

```yml
---
title: 'My awesome post title'
description: 'This post is about awesome stuff!'
date: '2016-07-25'
thumbnail: 'http://url-to-thumbnail.jpg'
authors:
  - FirstName LastName
---
```

Below the post meta, add your markdown:

```md
# Post Heading

This is an awesome paragraph!

## Post SubSection

[Link example](http://my-full-url-with-http-at-the-front.com)

* List item 1
* List item 2
* List item 3

```

To include code snippets in your post wrap them in <code>\`\`\`</code> blocks with the name of the syntax used. For example, to syntax highlight javascript code wrap the content in <code>\`\`\`js</code>

<pre>
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer vitae mauris arcu, eu pretium nisi. Praesent fringilla ornare ullamcorper.

```js
// code snippet with javascript syntax highlighting
console.log('JS code')
```
</pre>

---

### 4. Add your author bio

If you haven't created an author bio in the `/authors` folder. Go ahead and do that now.

The name of the file should be the same as the name field used in the blog post meta data. Format: `FirstnameLastname` (note the caps and no space!)

Example `authors/DavidWells.json` and `DavidWells` in the `authors` field below are the same name and capitalization.

```yml
---
layout: Post
title: 'David's Amazing Post'
authors:
 - David Wells # pulls data from authors/DavidWells.json
---
```
