## How to contribute content

### TDLR;

1. Generate a new post file with `npm run new`
2. Write your markdown
3. Commit to the repo

### 1. Write your content in markdown!

New to markdown? [Read this](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Checkout the [markdown styleguide](https://github.com/vendia/blog/blob/master/posts/typography.mdx) for examples on how to format things.

---

### 2. Name your post file name

Blog posts need to be titled with a date prefix. This helps us keep the content nice and organized here in git.

Make sure to prefix post titles with the year, month and date in this format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

**Example:**

`YYYY-MM-DD-blog-post-name.md` :point_right: `2016-01-27-post-title-here.md`

Here is a [handy tool for slugifying blog post titles](https://blog.tersmitten.nl/slugify/)

---

### 3. In your post, include post meta information:

Include the post metadata at the top:

```yml
---
title: 'My awesome post title'
description: 'This post is about awesome stuff!'
date: '2016-07-25'
thumbnail: 'http://url-to-thumbnail.jpg'
authors:
  - FirstName LastName
---
```

Below the post meta, add your markdown:

```md
# Post Heading

This is an awesome paragraph!

## Post SubSection

[Link example](http://my-full-url-with-http-at-the-front.com)

* List item 1
* List item 2
* List item 3

```

To include code snippets in your post wrap them in <code>\`\`\`</code> blocks with the name of the syntax used. For example, to syntax highlight javascript code wrap the content in <code>\`\`\`js</code>

<pre>
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer vitae mauris arcu, eu pretium nisi. Praesent fringilla ornare ullamcorper.

```js
// code snippet with javascript syntax highlighting
console.log('JS code')
```
</pre>

---

### 4. Add your author bio

If you haven't created an author bio in the `/authors` folder. Go ahead and do that now.

The name of the file should be the same as the name field used in the blog post meta data. Format: `FirstnameLastname` (note the caps and no space!)

Example `authors/DavidWells.json` and `DavidWells` in the `authors` field below are the same name and capitalization.

```yml
---
layout: Post
title: 'David's Amazing Post'
authors:
 - David Wells # pulls data from authors/DavidWells.json
---
```

## Adding Images

This repo will automatically download, optimize, upload all images to our CDN, and replace then image link in the markdown.

Example using an unsubmitted "draft" github issue to grab an image link.
