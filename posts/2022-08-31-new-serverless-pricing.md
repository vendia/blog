## Pricing Example

Let’s say your project runs a two-Node Universal Application across AWS and Azure. In the last month, the Universal application processed 100,000 transactions and added 50GB of file storage. Your Nodes responded to 1,000,000 queries and sent 1,000,000 notifications via GraphQL subscriptions, with subscriptions spanning 10,000 total hours.

**Additional Node Charges**

$0, as the first three of your owned Nodes are free.

**Transactions**

The transaction cost for a two-Node Universal application is $2.98 per 10,000 transactions. 100,000 / 10,000 x $2.98 x 2 Nodes = $59.60

**File Storage**

The file storage cost is $0.04 per GB-Month. 50 x $0.04 x 2 Nodes = $4.00

File transfer across clouds is $0.22 per GB-Month. 50 x $0.22 = $11.00

**Queries**

The query cost is $0.12 per 10,000 queries. 1,000,000 / 10,000 x $0.12 = $12.00

**Real-time Subscriptions**

The subscription cost is $0.30 per 100,000 messages. 1,000,000 / 100,000 x $0.30 = $3.00/month

Subscription time cost is $0.15 per 10,000 minutes. 100,000 hours / 100,000 minutes x $0.15 = $0.90/month

**Total charges**

$0 Node charges

$59.60 transactions

$15.00 file storage

$12.00 queries

$3.90 real-time subscriptions

**Total = $90.50**
