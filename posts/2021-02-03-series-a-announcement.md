Vendia Announces Series A Investment
====================================

We’re excited to announce that Vendia has raised a $15.5M Series A round, led
by Canvas Ventures with participation from BMW i Ventures, Sorenson Ventures,
and our existing seed investors, including Neotribe Ventures, Correlation
Ventures, WestWave Capital, Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, Firebolt Ventures,
and Future\Perfect Ventures. Vendia has raised a total of $20.6M since its
incorporation in March of 2020.

The rapid growth in the production and consumption of data and the
ever-increasing requirements for consistent and timely data sharing among
departments and business partners has created a massive market opportunity for
real-time data integration platforms. We’re excited to be partnering with our
new Series A and our existing Series Seed investors to serve customers and
grow Vendia to the next level. With the addition of new capital, Vendia will
accelerate its push into new sectors and expand its R&D staffing to enable us
to address exciting new use cases, including virtual data lakes, and to extend
Vendia Share to additional public cloud platforms to meet customer demand.

Why They Invested
=================

Both our seed and our Series A investors share our appreciation for the
challenges companies face in making their data work for them. We call it the
_dispersed data problem_ - companies process more and more data with every
passing year, but sharing that data effectively, and with appropriate control,
is actually getting harder over time. Legacy solutions, like EDI and sFTP can
take days to share and reconcile...a hopelessly long time in a world where end
user attention spans are measured in mere seconds. 

**Grace Isford of Canvas Ventures shared her thoughts on the opportunity Vendia represents,**
_"Fortune 500 companies are struggling to share data across internal siloes,
let alone share data securely. An increasing pace of regulatory requirements
adds further complexity, with nearly 80% of business data living outside of an
organization’s four walls. After scouring the DataOps landscape, we were
impressed by Vendia’s turn-key data-sharing solution, enabling organizations to
share data immutably at scale—with just a few lines of code. AWS powerhouses
Tim Wagner (Lambda’s founder) and Shruthi Rao (AWS Blockchain) have joined
forces to build a state-of-the-art serverless-blockchain platform that is poised
to be the new standard for data sharing.”_

While Vendia focuses on enterprise and SMB customers for its near-term business
goals, we’re also excited about another audience: Developers. We learned over
the years that successful platforms are built not just on well executed
go-to-market strategies, but also on making developers raging fans. Along with the
news about our Series A investment, we’re also excited to be launching the
Developer Preview of Vendia Share, bringing the platform that helped us grow our
business (and excite our investors) to every developer. You can read more about
our developer preview [here](https://www.vendia.net/blog/welcome-to-developer-preview).

Building a Partnership
======================

Like any hard-driving startup, we at Vendia are obsessed with serving our
customers and creating business outcomes that create value for our investors.
But we’re also a culture, and our [Kind Humans Policy](https://www.vendia.net/kind-humans)
is a statement about what we will - and what we won’t - do in search of business
results. We’re excited to partner with our Series A lead investor, Canvas
Ventures, not just because of their long track record of success, deep
understanding of our market, and the ability to help us accelerate with
capital, but also because of who they are: People who share our values, our
vision, and our culture. Our Canvas partners, Paul Hsiao and Grace Isford,
and the rest of their team exhibit integrity, kindness, and compassion - making
us proud to be a member of their family and to welcome them into ours!

Our Next Chapter
================

Our seed stage was shorter than we could have imagined, but we’ve enjoyed the
opportunity to operate as a small, closely knit crew. Now we turn the page,
fire up our recruiting engine again, and look forward to growing our company
and our business into the big shoes we’ve just been handed! 

_To all our investors - thank you for your conviction, your trust, and your partnership. Onward and upward!_
_To all our customers - thank you for trusting us to be your partner, we look forward to growing together with you!_
