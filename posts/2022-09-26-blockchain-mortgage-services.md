Centralized IT and blockchain technologies don’t need to be at odds with one another. Next-gen platforms give financial institutions the best of blockchain, plus the best of central IT to empower transformation, securely [share real-time data](https://www.vendia.net/blog/real-time-data-sharing-roundup), and eliminate errors and the need for massive reconciliation.

3. Deliver the compliance and security features that financial services require, including secure operational data sharing across partners, high throughput and low latency, integration with existing enterprise systems, and full lineage and traceability for all data types.


## Mortgage servicing with next-gen blockchain

Outside the financial services industry, a mortgage payment may seem like a simple payment from a borrower to a lender. However, insiders understand that, behind-the-scenes, critical data is continuously being shared and reconciled among various parties: 



* Lenders need to reconcile the status of debt and interest payments
* Servicers must ensure that property taxes and insurance premiums are paid to the right parties
* Organizations such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac need to keep track of mortgage transfers between servicers
*  Secondary markets that securitize mortgages must determine how to package mortgages into securities, including making necessary adjustments when borrowers delay or default on payments and providing appropriate disclosures

Because these are financial transactions, [every detail matters](https://www.vendia.net/blog/graphql-and-blockchain): The order of operations, the precision of shared calculations, and unanimous party agreement on a single source of truth regarding the status of every transaction. Accuracy, completeness, and up-to-date information are all key to the system’s correct functioning … and the health of each participating organization’s balance sheet. 

Operating in this sophisticated system without real-time data sharing can require weeks (or months) of manual reconciliation work across disjointed systems. It can also expose financial service providers to a range of bottom-line and regulatory risks. 


### Next-gen blockchains can create a golden record

Next-gen blockchains offer the various parties in a financial services ecosystem, such as mortgage servicing and securitization, a [single source of truth](https://www.vendia.net/blog/venn-diagramming-vendia-share) that’s accessible and visible to everyone—with a clear record of every transaction that occurred. Records cannot be tampered with or deleted, making disagreements over the source of truth impossible. Costly and repetitive dispute resolution processes are unnecessary, and parties can experience unprecedented levels of trust in their[ data alliance](https://www.vendia.net/blog/atos-success-story).

In the case of a mortgage servicing company, every party in the process can be connected to a shared set of records, visible and auditable by everyone participating in the network. This connection removes the delays and errors caused by disjointed and manual processes as records are shuffled from one party to another, often with errors or omissions being introduced. A next-gen blockchain approach also makes it possible to get a real-time view of risk exposure and cash flow movements without waiting for data reconciliation delays: Every party knows the status of every transaction (to which it has access) within seconds of that transaction taking place…even if it originated in the IT architecture of another company. 

The [structural benefits](https://thenewstack.io/are-blockchains-databases/) of blockchain include its immutability, transparency, and the ability for every party and system involved to trace every transaction and change that’s taken place. The new enabler is the scalability, cloud integration, and enterprise readiness of next-gen solutions. Together, these emergent benefits provide the foundation for an entirely new level of trust that can unlock innovation, new products, and competitive advantages for financial services organizations—from tracking mortgage servicing across providers to helping banks provide accurate and auditable environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data.
