Announcing the Vendia Share Developer Preview...And our Series A!
=================================================================

It’s an exciting day for Vendia - we’re pleased to [announce a $15.5M Series A investment](https://www.vendia.net/blog/series-a-announcement),
the launch of our [Developer Preview](https://www.vendia.net/blog/getting-started-with-vendia-share)
for Vendia Share, and to share some of our customers’ use cases!

We launched Vendia last year with a simple goal in mind: Help businesses and organizations
of all sizes create applications that span real-world divides. Gone are the days
when an application and its data was the province of a single company, operating
in isolation. Today’s apps span geographies, accounts, departments, clouds, and
even legal owners. From supply chains to logistics to financial settlement,
tracking goods and transactions has become a team sport.

Meanwhile, data is not just everywhere...there’s more of it. IoT, Mobile, Edge,
digital transformations by companies all over the world - all of these are
resulting in more data being created in more places. Meanwhile, data consumption
has become the new battleground, where staying competitive hinges on having
correct, consistent, and up-to-date information about customers, inventory,
logistics, and more. Now add partners and their own data creation mechanisms
and data silos and having an end-to-end view of data can feel like an impossibility.

Building infrastructure that can tackle this heavy lift of keeping data and the
code that operates on it synchronized across clouds, companies, regions,
accounts, and technology stacks is challenging, even for well staffed IT
organizations. Developers need a reliable, resilient, and scalable data
integration platform, and they don’t have the time or resources to DIY it from
the ground up.

_Enter Vendia Share_ - a simple, schema-driven platform that enables developers
to access cloud-native experiences without resorting to the “lowest common
denominator” of porting container software. We built Vendia Share to handle the
challenges of replicating and synchronizing data and code (modern day
“stored procedures”) so that application developers can focus on their business
logic, rather than how to create a distributed data storage and execution layer.

Our Customers
=============
Customers are already creating sophisticated business solutions using Vendia
Share. Food wholesalers work with a number of partners who have varying degrees
of IT capabilities. For some partners - such as logistics companies, food
producers, and warehouses - cell phones may function as their entire IT
department. This customer needed to reduce the time spent resolving
_Three-Way Matches_ - a process that compares the purchase order, the goods
receipt note, and the supplier's invoice before approving a supplier's invoice
for payment. It helps in determining whether the invoice should be paid partly
or in its entirety.

Before Vendia, this company manualy reconciled receipts via Excel spreadsheets,
phone calls, expensive procurement solutions and in some case through
point-to-point API calls. The result? An error rate in excess of 60%,
arbitration sought by partners in over 45% of exceptions, and a general distrust
in the underlying data that precluded monetization and optimization opportunities.

With Vendia, the company was able to create a simple mobile and web application
that captures data from partners. Vendia Share ensures that all parties involved
in a transaction see the same version of the data - a single source of truth.
In addition, when a delivery meets its SLA (on time, delivered in full,
and at an appropriate temperature), the application is now able to immediately
and automatically pay the partner with no human intervention and no errors.

Best Friends Animal Society is another Vendia customer with a particularly
poignant challenge: Returning lost pets that wind up in shelters to their
owners. Here, a failure to share data isn't just wasted time and money...it
can literally end an animal's life. By enabling easy sharing of animal
information across shelters, lost pet websites, veterinarian's, animal
safety workers, and owners, Vendia Share enables Best Friends to help ensure
that all pets get home safely.

_Angie Embree, CIO, Best Friends Animal Society says: “Ending the killing in US
animal shelters by the end of 2025 is our goal at Best Friends Animal Society
and we deliver lifesaving companion animal programs in partnership with more
than 2,500 animal welfare groups across the country. We have helped reduce the
number of dogs and cats killed in shelters nationwide from 17 million per year
to under 650,000 and those last animals are the hardest. To effectively care for
shelter pets and find them forever homes, the animal welfare community needs
reliable, trustworthy, real time data. We love Vendia because not only it is
simple to share data in an easy, scalable way without upfront investment but
also because the animal welfare community can take advantage of cutting edge
Serverless Distributed Ledger technology without having to learn new concepts.
We are now able to build applications that return more lost pets to their
families, know where shelters might euthanize for space and help them by moving
those animals, and easily exchange data between systems as well as other apps
on the Vendia platform.”_

Welcome, Developers!
====================

At Vendia we obsess about our customers and are excited by their successes.
But our mission also extends to developers - we want to help them experience an
easier way to build applications. Our background in selling public cloud services
taught that there are two frequent roadblocks when trying to get developers to
adopt managed services: Their proprietary nature and the lack of a common data
model. These can create a “walled garden” that often drives companies and
developers to adopt technologies that they admit are more complex and expensive,
just to avoid the potential for lock-in or to overcome the real-world challenges
of needing to create blended solutions that involve data and services from more
than a single cloud service provider. We created Vendia Share to span clouds and
to expose the best each cloud has to offer, rather than insist on “lowest common
denominator porting”.

With Vendia Share’s Developer Preview, developers can try out our platform on AWS for
free and experience its unique ability to help them create multi-region,
multi-account, and multi-party applications from a data schema instead of through
complex application code. We’ve built Vendia using a Serverless architecture,
but we don’t require that developers share our opinion - the platform’s fault
tolerance, scalability, and lack of infrastructure complexity is
just as useful for developers who prefer containers, servers, or even API calls
from an on-prem mainframe.
