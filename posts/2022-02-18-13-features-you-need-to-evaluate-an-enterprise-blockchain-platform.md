"A platform is a product that serves or enables other products or services. Platforms (in the context of digital business) exist at many levels. They range from high-level platforms that enable a platform business model to low-level platforms that provide a collection of business and/or technology capabilities that other products or services consume to deliver their own business capabilities," [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/platform-digital-business).

## The platform for decentralized applications

Between 2017-2021, during my time at AWS, every conversation with new cloud customers would start with TCO analysis between on-premises and cloud. But, soon, the conversation would evolve into how the cloud can enable or fast-track new value creation that comes from increased experimentation and improvement in time to market. 

I remember having a conversation with the CIO of a Fortune 500 company about agility and experimentation. If I can trust my memory, in his words, "My customers are impatient about new features, and to serve my customer, I have to be impatient like my customers about new feature delivery. To deliver innovation at speed, I need to equip my developers with the right tools and the platform. I want to keep both my customers and developers happy". Yes, it's the developers' job to release new features faster. **But, it is IT leaders who should provide the right platform to developers to experiment and execute at the desired speed.**

These examples are in the context of centralized software development (Web2), but the same principles will apply to decentralized software development powered by blockchain (Web3).

So far, I am impressed by the progress and improvement in the tooling required to build and deploy decentralized software on public and private blockchain platforms. But, current experience and tooling are far from optimal for the rapid development of blockchain application proof of concepts, value, and delivery of value. 

Managed Blockchain Services are evolving rapidly-heavyweights such as [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/blockchain/#overview) and [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/) support the blockchain ecosystem by launching new services. In 2020, [Vendia](https://www.vendia.com/) launched [Vendia Share](https://www.vendia.com/docs/share), a Serverless Blockchain Service. 

I know choices in blockchain platform services are still limited. Still, it is good to look at the fundamental list of features your organization needs to support the business needs for blockchain application development before you pick a platform for blockchain application development. 

**This post lists 13 features important for blockchain platform evaluation in an enterprise organization.**


## Blockchain evaluation criteria 

Here is the best effort compilation of features and questions your decentralized application and services teams will expect from the blockchain platform. 


## 1. **Programmability** 

* _What specific programming languages are supported?_
* _What development IDE is used for programming?_
* _Are there programming frameworks available for software development?_
* _How easy is it to test and debug code in supported programming languages?_
* _How long is the learning curve for a new programming language?_
* _What are key optimizations required to deploy code in supported programming languages?_


## 2. **Scalability** 

* _What type of scaling is used?_
* _What are the upper limits?_
* _How is scaling triggered - reactive, or predictive?_
* _Is adaptive scaling supported?_
* _Is the platform multi-tenant or dedicated?_
* _Does it have a noisy neighbor problem?_


## 3. **Upgradability**

* _What is the track record of the developers for delivering enhancements and upgrades?_
* _How are upgrades delivered?_
* _If using open source, how frequently are upgrades on open source software available?_
* _Is there a cost for applying upgrades?_
* _Who is responsible for what software upgrade?_
* _What kind of custom packages are supported and how does it impact support?_
	
## 4. **Transaction Manageability**

* _Is there real-time transparency for all transactions?_
* _Does it support writes from multiple locations?_
* _How are write conflicts handled?_
* _How are failed transactions handled?_
	
## 5. **Visibility**

* _Do you have a full view on the blockchain activity?_
* _Does blockchain provide success/failure feedback?_
* _Is the system feedback easily interpretable?_
* _Is the visibility provided in a reasonable time?_
	
## 6. **Affordability**

* _What is the capital cost of new application deployment?_
* _What is the minimum operational cost?_
* _What is the marginal cost of deploying a new decentralized application on a platform?_
* _What other support costs need to be accounted for to operate the production environment?_
	
## 7. **Security**

* _What is the documented confidence level in the platform security?_
* _What compliance and assurance certifications are available as proof?_
* _What popular open source software is used to build a platform?_
* _How are participants added?_
* _Who has what level of control?_
* _How is fine grained access control supported and at what granularity?_
* _What kind of attacks are common?_
* _What kind of protection and mitigation are supported?_
* _What existing software tools and services can be used for security perimeter hardening and monitoring?_
* _How is the network secured?_
* _What are different layers, and how is security responsibility shared?_
	
## 8. **Performance** 

* _What are the upper limits of validating transactions?_
* _What are primary performance bottlenecks?_
* _What controls and tradeoffs exist to improve performance?_
* _Is there a guide on performance best practices?_
	
## 9. **High Availability** 

* _What are the uptime track records?_
* _Which parts are centralized, and how can they be decentralized?_
* _What is the dependency on partners?_
* _What kind of SLAs are provided by partners?_
* _What are best practices for improving resilience and availability?_
* _Is the platform self-healing?_
* _What kind of visibility is provided to consumers during outages?_
* _What is the communication mechanism used for reporting and tracking outages?_
	
## 10. **Extensibility**

* _How easy is it to add participants to the platform?_
* _How can you extend domain models supported on the platform?_
* _Does it support open interfaces for third party applications integrations?_
* _What type of partner integrations are supported out of the box?_
	
## 11. **Interoperability**

* _Does it interoperate with other related technologies?_
	
## 12. **Open Source**

* _What components are open source, and what are proprietary?_
* _What is the variety of collaboration and contributions from a variety of developers?_
* _How frequently are new versions of the open source code upgraded?_
	
## 13. **Sustainability**

* _How much of the platform runs on renewable energy sources?_
* _Does the platform use inefficient algorithms?_
