**How to get started:**


1. Sign up for Vendia at[ share.vendia.net](http://share.vendia.net) and let us know what you are building[ here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddHKsTRHZ_a2U8fl_3FhTgZCwIblODbVj32phmQ8W9eEp1Iw/viewform?usp=sf_link)
2. We will get back to you with an official üëç and guidelines for writing an engaging tutorial
3. Build your sample app and tutorial and post it to your Github with the ‚ÄúDeploy to Vendia Button‚Äù

The fine print: (Our legal team made us do this): The offer is active until August 1, 2022. Each participant can only participate once. In order to receive the offer, the participant must have received initial approval, and posted a completed tutorial of at least 500 words on Github with the Deploy to Vendia Button, AND shared the tutorial on at least one of the following social media channels (Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok). (We doubt this will happen, but to be sure) Vendia reserves the right to revoke the offer at any time for any reason
