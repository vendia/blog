In 2021, the Deloitte Center for Financial Services [surveyed](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/US164678_CFS-banking-and-capital-markets-outlook/DI_CFS-banking-and-capital-markets-outlook.pdf) global leaders inside financial services firms: Seven in ten leaders revealed they struggle to use data and technology effectively. But, there’s unlimited potential to leverage the vast volume of financial and customer data to modernize data sharing and unlock real-time outcomes. For instance, as [reported](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/quantumblack/our-insights/the-data-driven-enterprise-of-2025?suid=SU00241&medium=li&cmp=401) by McKinsey, as soon as 2025, the most innovative organizations will be organizing and supporting data assets as products, regardless of whether they're used by internal teams, external customers, or a permission-based partner network. 


#### **The challenge facing financial services firms is discovering how to share financial and customer data across applications, departments, partners, and clouds—in a _secure_, _trusted_, and _accurate_ way. **

And that challenge is complex: 



* How can you scale solutions for immediate impact and easy adoption? 
* How can you ensure seamless integration with legacy, DIY, or partners’ enterprise systems, transact quickly and securely, and guarantee uptime? 
* And [how can you do it](https://www.vendia.com/blog/venn-diagramming-vendia-share) without exhausting internal resources and IT budgets or by building systems that require costly ongoing maintenance, compliance, and operational overhead?


## When will blockchain live up to its promise?

During the last ten years, blockchain technology has offered financial institutions the promise of a shared data ecosystem. But too many of those first-generation blockchains — whether public or private — [fell short](https://www.vendia.com/blog/why-blockchains-databases-api-cannot-standalone-as-it-solutions) of their potential. They lacked the enterprise readiness, scalability, and cloud compatibility required for success. 


### Next-gen blockchains offer a way forward
