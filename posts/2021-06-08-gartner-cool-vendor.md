A little over a year ago we came out of stealth (in the midst of a pandemic),  and launched our first preview of Vendia Share. Since then, we've been hard at work building out one-week proof of concepts and helping our customers deploy Vendia to production, and closed a Series A investment round. Today, we're thrilled to be included in Gartner's May 2021 "[Cool Vendors in Cloud Computing](https://www.gartner.com/doc/4001590?ref=clientFriendlyURL)" report by Arun Chandrasekaran, Sid Nag, and David Wright!

According to Gartner: "A multicloud strategy is becoming inevitable for most global enterprises, but it brings security, integration, cost and governance challenges. CIOs should assess these Cool Vendors that are disrupting the cloud market through robust multi cloud implementation products."  

Business critical data is dispersed across both internal and external silos and across clouds, making it nearly impossible to control and share in real time. Vendia helps companies transform how applications are developed by giving customers (and developers!) the ability to synchronize and share code or data from anywhereâ€”across clouds, partners, business units, spreadsheets, and more, with a single source of truth, immutability, and control.  This can radically transform how organizations approach modernization and transformation projects to build universal, cloud-agnostic applications. 

Multi-party applications powered by Vendia enable automation and workflows to span company boundaries, while still giving each participant a full copy of its data in a traditional cloud-hosted environment, even as it's being continuously synchronized with partners. Deployment is also innovative: despite the high performance implementation, it's done entirely through a SaaS-style model that eliminates the need for customers to deploy, manage, scale, or secure their own infrastructure components. Distributed ledger technology and serverless compute models used for data triggers have been reimagined to be as easy to use as conventional "centralized" databases...despite spanning companies, clouds, geographies, and tech stacks. Vendia's novel approach enables a data model (JSON Schema) to be turned into a production deployment for all parties[ in under 10 minutes.](https://www.vendia.com/poc)

Vendia is being used in production today  to power multi-party distributed applications for track and trace of goods and services across complex supply chains, financial settlements and transactions, and real-time data analytics for AI/ML and IoT use cases. Since Vendia uses a serverless implementation, building distributed, multi-party apps with Vendia is  scalable, cost efficient, and developer friendly. 

We are delighted that Gartner recognizes Vendia as a Cool Vendor at a time when multi-cloud enterprise challenges (and associated opportunities) continue to heat up! To access the report, visit [Gartner]( https://www.gartner.com/doc/4001590?ref=clientFriendlyURL).
