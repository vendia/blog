**What drew you to your work in engineering, and what keeps bringing you back?**\
As a kid, computers (and technology, in general) seemed like magic, and I wanted to learn how it all worked. The magic starts to fade with understanding, but in engineering there‚Äôs always something new to learn.

**What do you love about working in Vendia Engineering?**\
I love that Vendia is truly remote-first. My family was able to move back to Australia, and I‚Äôm able to continue working with world-class engineers and people from other disciplines.

### David Wells

**Role:** Full Stack Engineer\
**Homebase:** San Francisco, CA, USA\
**Hobbies:** Coding üòé\
**Go-to karaoke song:** Johnny Cash, ‚ÄúFolsom Prison Blues‚Äù\
**Find David** on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davidwells) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidgwells/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/DavidWells)

**What drew you to your work in engineering, and what keeps bringing you back?**\
I began programming because I needed a website but didn't have any money to pay someone to build it for me. So, I just started googling things, tinkering around, and slowly but surely learned "how things work." Learning to code, like any other skill, is just a simple process of accumulation. It‚Äôs a journey of trial and error. 

Fast forward 10 years, and here I am at Vendia building a bunch of different things from our website, to our user service, to the CLI. 

I write code because it helps me solve problems in a much more efficient way, which, in turn, gives me back lots of time to solve other problems. It's a giant force multiplier.

I believe that every human is a polymath and has the innate capability to leverage this skill to "code", if they so choose. 

Don't be afraid of other hats. Try them all on.  Here‚Äôs the full story of [how I learned to code](https://davidwells.io/blog/practical-advice-on-learning-to-code).

**What do you love about working on the Vendia Engineering team?**\
I love working with the Vendia engineering team because we have a bunch of folks who have worked on some GIANT infrastructure services that have massively scaled like API Gateway, AWS Athena, DDB, and AWS Lambda. This kind of knowledge is hard to come by at a small startup, and it feels like we have rocket boosters for what we are trying to build.

Additionally, the way folks work is interesting to see. We frequently have design docs and reviews on the systems we are building, and I'm always learning something new.

On top of all this, I'm a huge proponent of serverless architectures and our stack is entirely serverless üòÉ. It's incredible the outcomes you can achieve with managed cloud services these days. It's an extra added bonus that a large portion of the team worked on the serverless services that we use to deliver Vendia to our users.

**What does a productive, rewarding weekday look like for you?**\
A productive day to me looks like this:

- Create a written plan of action for tomorrow 
- Go to sleep at decent hour
- Wake up (maybe snooze button once or twice)
- Have coffee outside in the morning sun 
- Then get into a flow state knocking down items from the plan of action
- If I need a break, going on a walk outside is my go-to

Flow state or deep work is an incredible thing. The world melts away and you completely immerse yourself in the task at hand. 

If I've achieved a flow state and learned something new that day, I consider it a success.

### Matt Silverstein

**Role:** Senior Fullstack Engineer\
**Homebase:** San Diego, CA, USA\
**Hobbies:** Books, Art/Design, Houseplants, Video games\
**Go to karaoke song:** Bill Withers, Lean on Me\
**Now streaming**: Ambient electronica\
**Find Matt** on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/silversteez) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattsilverstein/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/silversteez)

**What does a productive, rewarding weekday look like for you?** \
Working as an individual contributor on a remote-first engineering team means I spend the bulk of my time at home, alone, which I LOVE. I love my wife and *mostly* enjoy the chaos of raising young kids as well, but I treasure the quiet, focused time that comprises most of my work days at Vendia. Most days involve one or two meetings with coworkers to sync up and collaborate on larger initiatives, but we keep meetings to a minimum and lean into async communication (Slack, Notion docs, Github Issues) when possible.

Additional perks of working remotely include homemade snacks, matcha lattes, quick 5 minute stretches/workouts, and random breaks with my wife (who also works remotely) whenever I want! 

**What drew you to your work in engineering, and what keeps you coming back?** \
Before segueing into engineering-focused roles, I worked in the games industry in, primarily, art and design roles that included light scripting work from time to time. At the time, I didn‚Äôt think I was capable of ‚Äúreal‚Äù programming, nor did I think I would enjoy it. After a big company layoff, I took some time to dabble with building my own mobile game and begrudgingly endeavored to learn C# so I could handle the coding duties, as well as what I assumed would be the fun stuff ‚Äî the design, animation, and music. It wasn‚Äôt long, however, before I found myself enjoying the creative problem-solving involved in authoring code and craving the addictive feedback loop of struggling with a bit of code, conquering it, and finally seeing the results on screen.

I‚Äôm solving a new set of problems in my current role at Vendia, but I still crave that feedback loop. It never gets old!

### Jake Partusch

**Role:** Senior Full-stack Engineer\
**Homebase:** Omaha, NE, USA\
**Hobbies:** Golf, Sand Volleyball, Reading \
**Go to karaoke song:** Anything by Queen\
**Now pod-ing:** [‚ÄúPeople I (Mostly) Admire‚Äù](https://freakonomics.com/series-full/people-i-mostly-admire/) with Steven Levitt\
**Find Jake** on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jakepartusch) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-partusch-4a181b79/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/JakePartusch)

**What drew you to your work in engineering, and what keeps bringing you back?**\
Engineering is all about solving interesting problems with incomplete data and competing priorities. I love solving the nitty-gritty details of a tough engineering problem, but I enjoy the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù aspect that comes with every new feature or bug even more. That means answering questions like: 

- What is the user experience for customers? 
- How can we improve that experience? 
- How much time/budget can we devote to solving this problem? 
- How can we design a solution that is easy for other engineers to understand and support?

**What do you love about working in Vendia Engineering?**\
Our engineering team is full of intelligent, hard-working, and kind individuals. I love collaborating with the team to dream up, design, and implement new features for our customers. As a full-stack engineer I (luckily) have the opportunity to work, not only with the engineering team, but with the Vendia team as a whole. I‚Äôm able to listen to feedback from our Solution Architects working with customers, define requirements with the Product team, envision a great customer experience with our Design team, and implement and iterate on a solution with fellow engineers.

**What‚Äôs the best advice you‚Äôve received in your career?** \
One of the things that I‚Äôve learned, in part because my mentors have taught me this, is that it‚Äôs really hard to predict the future, but it‚Äôs essential to make plans. For Vendia, especially as such a young company, we can make predictions. We absolutely place bets. But, we also have plans that help us create, iterate, pivot when needed, and win. 

**What do you love about working on the Vendia Engineering team?**\
What we do in engineering directly impacts every aspect of our company. And my role is pretty fantastic because I‚Äôm so close to our customers: I‚Äôm at the intersection of what we at Vendia want the future to be and what our customers tell us the future *should* be. And I get to work with really smart people who can help me realize BOTH of those outcomes.
