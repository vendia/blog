# Happy Birthday, Vendia!

Vendia turns one year old today as an incorporated company. A year ago, Shruthi and I had just signed a term sheet for our
seed stage investment, led by the amazing investors at Neotribe, and finalized the paperwork to become an official Delaware C-corporation.

In the year since, we've hired a fantastic team,
launched our enterprise product, Vendia Share, and had the privilege of serving customers in sectors as diverse
as automotive, travel, construction, and animal care. A huge "thank you" to our customers, our investors, our
employees, and the multitude of folks who've offered their help, advice, and insight along the way.

While many things have changed over the last year, our mission - to help customers share data and build applications
that span companies, clouds, geographies, and technologies - has not. We remain committed to the goal of helping businesses
share and leverage their most critical operational data simply, securely, and with control. Happy first birthday, Vendia - here's to many more!
