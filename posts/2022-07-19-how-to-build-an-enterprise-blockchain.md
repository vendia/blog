# Q&A: Build an enterprise blockchain with serverless

Join hosts Peter Sbarski, AWS Serverless Hero and Dr. Tim Wagner, co-founder of Vendia and inventor of AWS Lambda for a in-depth interview about how Vendia built an enterprise-grade, scalable blockchain to make multi-party data sharing easy.

Details: Wed, August 3, 2022 | 3 pm PST | [Register](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/6216584365998/WN_xi0SssiyS2G_oQjZbyONkw)

_All registrants will receive a recording and written overview_


Dr. Tim Wagner will talk through how he combined the latest in serverless and cloud computing to build a fault-tolerant, scalable blockchain solution. He realized that the strengths and weaknesses of APIs, cloud databases, and blockchains complicated each other, enabling a scalable enterprise-ready distributed ledger.
