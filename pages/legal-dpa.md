      **Recitals**


      1. Vendia has entered into one or more purchase orders, contracts and/or agreements (the "**Agreement(s)”**) with CUSTOMER and/or CUSTOMER Affiliates (as defined below). In delivering the Services under the Agreements, Vendia may Process Personal Data controlled by CUSTOMER, a CUSTOMER Affiliate and/or their respective customers, contacts or partners.
