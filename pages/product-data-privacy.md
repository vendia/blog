      ## A better shared responsibility model


      Compliance is hard and comes with a lot of risks, costs, and complexities. Vendia's shared responsibility model allows customers to focus on their data, while Vendia takes care of the heavy lifting associated with infrastructure. 


      The outcome? You keep control of your data, adhere to privacy laws, and reduce risk without the need for hundreds of additional IT controls.
