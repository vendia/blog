      ### Meet the founders


      Tim Wagner, Ph.D., and Shruthi Rao envisioned a better way for businesses to shared data and, at the same time, eliminate cost centers. It’s why Vendia was founded.


      As they talked with +1,100 technology and line of business leaders, they discovered they all needed the same thing — a way to accelerate time to innovation and share a single copy of truth, no matter what technology they and their data-sharing partners use.
