      ### Meet the founders


      Tim Wagner, Ph.D., and Shruthi Rao envisioned a better way for businesses to share data and, at the same time, eliminate cost centers.


      **[Check out their origin story](https://www.vendia.com/blog/meet-vendias-founders)**


      As they talked with +1,100 technology and line of business leaders, they discovered they all needed the same thing — a way to accelerate time to innovation and share a single copy of truth, no matter what technology they and their data-sharing partners use.
