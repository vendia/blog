      ## Statement from Vendia on the impact of the SVB collapse


      Tuesday, March 14, 2023


      With the continued news cycle surrounding the Silicon Valley Bank crisis this week, Vendia wants to ensure our customers, employees, and partners that the SVB collapse has not negatively impacted us.


      **Business continues normally for us**.


      While the Federal Reserve, Treasury Department, and FDIC thankfully provided a solution to protect American workers and small businesses, we know this has been a time of extreme stress and uncertainty for many of our friends in the startup community. We are sending our support to fellow founders and VCs as they continue to navigate related challenges.
