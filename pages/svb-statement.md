      ## Statement from Vendia


      Tuesday, March 14, 2023


      With the continued news cycle surrounding the Silicon Valley Bank crisis this week, Vendia would like to ensure our customers, employees, and partners that business continues as normal for us. In the wake of the news on Thursday, our team proactively created and executed a multi-bank strategy and there have been no disruptions to our AR/AP processes.


      While The Federal Reserve, Treasury Department, and FDIC thankfully provided a solution to protect American workers and small businesses, we know this has been a time of extreme stress and uncertainty for many of our friends in the startup community and we are sending our thoughts and support to fellow founders and VCs as they continue to navigate related challenges.
