      ## Getting started


      Vendia’s platform eliminates the need for DIY API creation and underlying infrastructure design, provisioning, and management.


      All you need is a JSON schema – Vendia does the rest.   


      Vendia Share compiles that schema into serverless resources customized to your model and then deploys a powerful, fully-managed https-based GraphQL engine for reading and writing your data, with full type checking.
