      Over the last few weeks, the Vendia Engineering team has been hard at work
      finalizing a number of changes that will greatly improve the data modeling
      capabilities for our users. In addition, the automatically generated
      GraphQL interface and resolvers have also been improved to provide native
      GraphQL support for enumerations.


      In doing so, we made the difficult choice to address several known issues in ways that will not be backwards compatible. Because some of these changes will impact existing Unis, we've created a [detailed blog post](https://www.vendia.com/blog/open-beta-changes) to help those with the migration process. We're confident these changes, once released, will make for a significantly better experience for current and future users.
