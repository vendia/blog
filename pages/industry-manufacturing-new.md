      altText: An isomorphic image in shades of Vendia violet, plum, aqua, and
        seafoam; at the center is a square platform with the Vendia logo on it;
        the logo shines up a tower of transparent aqua light (like data being
        teleported) toward a globe showing North America, the Atlantic Ocean,
        Europe, the Middle East, and Africa; paths extend out from the platform
        in four directions; moving clockwise from about 1 o'clock, in one
        direction, the paths connect to a lock; at 3 o'clock the paths connect
        to a server; at 8 o'clock, the paths connect to a cloud with an upload
        arrow on it; at 10 o'clock, the paths connect to a database stack;
        underneath all the other graphic elements are segmented concentric
        circles suggesting simultaneous flow between all the elements with
        Vendia Share (represented by Vendia's logo) at the heart of it all
