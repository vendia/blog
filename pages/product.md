      ## Get started with Vendia Share


      The Vendia Share platform eliminates the need for DIY API creation and the underlying infrastructure design, provisioning, and management.


      All you need is a JSON schema. Vendia Share does the rest. 


      Vendia Share compiles that JSON schema into serverless resources customized to your model and then deploys a powerful, fully-managed https-based GraphQL engine for reading and writing your data with full type checking.
