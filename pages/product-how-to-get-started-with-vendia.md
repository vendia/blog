          > ### Step 1


          ## Design your data model


          Create a data model using JSON. You can choose an existing industry standard data schema or customize your own. You can always change it later, Vendia will adapt its infrastructure automatically.

          Configure connectors to third-party data sources and integrate with web, mobile, and cloud applications using Vendia's automatically generated APIs. We even offer multiple connectors that are ready to go.
