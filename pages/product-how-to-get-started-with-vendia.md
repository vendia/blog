          > ### Step 1


          ## Design your data model


          Create a data model using JSON. You can choose an existing industry standard data schema or customize your own. You can always change it later, Vendia will adapt its infrastructure automatically.

          > ### Step 2


          ## Connect your data and applications


          Configure connectors to third-party data sources and integrate with web, mobile, and cloud applications using Vendia's automatically generated APIs. We even offer multiple connectors that are ready to go.
