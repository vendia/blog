      ### General Terms


      Last updated: November 26, 2021.


      This Vendia Services Agreement (this “**Agreement**”) contains the terms and conditions that govern your access to and use of our Services (as defined below) and is an agreement between Vendia, Inc. (also referred to as “**Vendia**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”) and you or the entity you represent (referred to as “**you**” or “**your**”). This Agreement takes effect when you click an “I Accept” button or check box presented with these terms or, if earlier, when you use any of the Services (the “**Effective Date**”). You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts (e.g., you are not a minor). If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that entity. Please see Section 15 for definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement. 


      #### **1. Use of the Services.**


      1.1 Generally. You may access and use the Services in accordance with this Agreement. Service Level Agreements and Service Terms apply to certain Service Offerings (all as defined below). You will comply with the terms of this Agreement and all laws, rules and regulations applicable to your use of the Services.


      1.2. You may not transfer outside the Services any software (exclusive of public Github repository content) you obtain from us or third party licensors in connection with the Services without specific authorization to do so.


      1.3. You must comply with current technical documentation applicable to the Services (including applicable developer guides) posted on the Vendia Site.


      1.4 You agree to follow any technical, operational, or development guidelines issued by Vendia with respect to interacting with the Services and associated APIs.


      1.5. You will provide information or other materials related to Your Content (including copies of any client-side applications) as reasonably requested by us to verify your compliance with the Agreement. You will reasonably cooperate with us to identify the source of any problem with the Services that we reasonably believe may be attributable to Your Content or any end user materials that you control.


      1.6. If you upload software (such as a smart contract) to the Services, you agree that you have, and can provide upon request to us or our agents, clear license and title to use the software in that manner. Similarly, for any data you upload to the Services you agree you are not in violation of content, usage, or other licenses, restrictions, laws, copyrights, or regulations through the creation, possession, or usage of such data.  If we reasonably believe any of Your Content violates the law, infringes or misappropriates the rights of any third party, or otherwise violates a material term of this Agreement (including the documentation, the Service Terms, or the Acceptable Use Policy) (“Prohibited Content”), we may notify you of the Prohibited Content and may request that such content be removed from the Services or have its access disabled (though we are not required to detect and report such violations on your behalf). If we request that you take action and you do not remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content within 2 business days of our notice, we may remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content or suspend the Services to the extent we are not able to remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may remove or disable access to any Prohibited Content without prior notice in connection with illegal content, where the content may disrupt or threaten the Services or in accordance with applicable law or any judicial, regulatory or other governmental order or request. In the event that we remove Your Content without prior notice, we will provide prompt notice to you unless prohibited by law. We terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances. *Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are not required to evaluate or monitor your content and are not responsible for your compliance with laws, regulations, licenses, contracts, or other requirements to which you or your content may be subject.*


      1.7. You agree your communications with Vendia regarding your applications, data, usage, billing, and all other matters will be accurate and complete.


      1.8 In the event of a serious security or operational event, you agree to reasonable and timely cooperation to prevent damage to Vendia or its customers by applying patches, upgrading services, or similar activities when directed by us.


      1.9. From time to time, we may apply upgrades, patches, bug fixes, or other maintenance to the Services and Vendia Content (“Maintenance”). We agree to use reasonable efforts to provide you with prior notice of any scheduled Maintenance (except for emergency Maintenance), and you agree to use reasonable efforts to comply with any Maintenance requirements that we notify you about.


      1.10. You agree not to engage in DDOS, "pen tests", security vulnerability testing, stress, or benchmark testing (each, a “Benchmark”) , or other forms of usage outside of normal development and production use without written permission from us.

You agree to abide by the terms of the cloud vendor service agreement (and any other applicable agreements) and to financial responsibility for your use of those services. *You explicitly agree that Vendia's interaction with such services, such as calling their APIs or adding or modifying data in them, does not alter your financial responsibility or create any financial responsibility on the part of Vendia.* 


      1.12. When you use a Service, you may be able to use or be required to use one or more other Services (each, an “Associated Service”), and when you use an Associated Service, you are subject to the terms and fees that apply to that Associated Service.


      1.13. If you process the personal data of End Users or other identifiable individuals in your use of a Service, you are responsible for providing legally adequate privacy notices and obtaining necessary consents for the processing of such data. You represent to us that you have provided all necessary privacy notices and obtained all necessary consents. You are responsible for processing such data in accordance with applicable law.


      1.14. If you have been charged for a Service Offering for a period when that Service Offering was unavailable or operating with reduced capacity, you may be entitled to a service credit. The Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) for that Service Offering shall determine the nature and extent of any such credit.


      1.15. You agree to prompt and full payment of Vendia charges and that we may suspend your use of our Services if your account is in arrears by more than 30 days.


      **1.16. Data Protection.**

      1.16.2. Following closure of your Vendia account, we will delete Your Content except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the documentation or Service Terms for the applicable Service Offering.


      #### **2. Changes.**


      2.1 To the Services. We may change or discontinue any of the Services from time to time. We will provide you at least 6 months prior notice if we discontinue material functionality of a Service Offering that you are using, and at least 3 months prior notice if we materially alter a customer-facing API that you are using in a backwards-incompatible fashion, except that this notice will not be required if the applicable notice period (a) would pose a security or intellectual property issue to us, other customers, or the Services, (b) is economically or technically burdensome, or (c) would cause us to violate legal requirements.


      2.2 To the Service Level Agreements. We may change, discontinue or add Service Level Agreements from time to time in accordance with Section 13.


      #### **3. Security and Data Privacy.**


      3.1 Vendia Security. We will implement reasonable and appropriate measures designed to help you secure Your Content against accidental or unlawful loss, access or disclosure.


      3.2 Data Privacy. You may specify the cloud service provider(s) (the **“CSP”**) and region(s) in which Your Content will be stored. You consent to the storage of Your Content in, and transfer of Your Content into, all CSP regions you select. If you use the Services to create data sharing relationships with others (“Partners”), you consent to the transfer of your data to, and their data from, the CSPs and regions in which your Partners operate. We will not access or use Your Content except as necessary to maintain or provide the Services, or as necessary to comply with the law or a binding order of a governmental body. We will not (a) disclose Your Content to any government or third party, move Your Content from the CSP regions selected by you (except to perform the data sharing relationships with your Partners as you have requested of our Services); except in each case as necessary to comply with the law or a binding order of a governmental body. Unless it would violate the law or a binding order of a governmental body, we will give you notice of any legal requirement or order referred to in this Section 3.2. We will only use your Account Information in accordance with the Privacy Notice, and you consent to such usage. The Privacy Notice does not apply to Your Content.


      3.3 Service Attributes. To provide billing and administration services, we may process Service Attributes in the CSP region(s) where you use the Services and the CSP regions in the United States. To provide you with support services initiated by you and investigate fraud, abuse or violations of this Agreement, we may process Service Attributes where we maintain our support and investigation personnel.


      #### **4. Your Responsibilities.**


      4.1 Your Accounts. Except to the extent caused by our breach of this Agreement, (a) you are responsible for all activities that occur under your account, regardless of whether the activities are authorized by you or undertaken by you, your employees or a third party (including your contractors, agents or End Users), and (b) we and our affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized access to your account.


      4.2 Your Content. You will ensure that Your Content and your and End Users’ use of Your Content or the Services will not violate any of the Policies or any applicable law. You are solely responsible for the development, content, operation, maintenance, and use of Your Content.


      4.3 Your Security and Backup. You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Services and otherwise taking appropriate action to secure, protect and backup your accounts and Your Content in a manner that will provide appropriate security and protection, which might include use of encryption to protect Your Content from unauthorized access and routinely archiving Your Content.


      4.4 Log-In Credentials and Account Keys. Vendia log-in credentials and private keys generated by the Services are for your internal use only and you will not sell, transfer or sublicense them to any other entity or person, except that you may disclose your private key to your agents and subcontractors performing work on your behalf.


      4.5 End Users. You will be deemed to have taken any action that you permit, assist or facilitate any person or entity to take related to this Agreement, Your Content or use of the Services. You are responsible for End Users’ use of Your Content and the Services. You will ensure that all End Users comply with your obligations under this Agreement and that the terms of your agreement with each End User are consistent with this Agreement. If you become aware of any violation of your obligations under this Agreement caused by an End User, you will immediately suspend access to Your Content and the Services by such End User. *We do not provide any support or services to End Users unless we have a separate agreement with you or an End User obligating us to provide such support or services.* 


      #### **5. Fees and Payment.**


      5.1 Service Fees. We calculate and bill fees and usage-related charges monthly. We may bill you more frequently for fees accrued if we suspect that your account is fraudulent or at risk of non-payment. You will pay us the applicable fees and charges for use of the Services as described on the Vendia Site using one of the payment methods we support. All amounts payable by you under this Agreement will be paid to us without setoff or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding. Fees and charges for any new Service Offering or new feature of a Service Offering will be effective when we post updated fees and charges on the Vendia Site, unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Service Offerings you are using by giving you at least 30 days prior notice. We may elect to charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments.


      5.2 Taxes. Each party will be responsible, as required under applicable law, for identifying and paying all taxes and other governmental fees and charges (and any penalties, interest, and other additions thereto) that are imposed on that party upon or with respect to the transactions and payments under this Agreement. All fees payable by you are exclusive of Indirect Taxes, except where applicable law requires otherwise. We may charge and you will pay applicable Indirect Taxes that we are legally obligated or authorized to collect from you. You will provide such information to us as reasonably required to determine whether we are obligated to collect Indirect Taxes from you. We will not collect, and you will not pay, any Indirect Tax for which you furnish us a properly completed exemption certificate or a direct payment permit certificate for which we may claim an available exemption from such Indirect Tax. All payments made by you to us under this Agreement will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding, except as may be required by law. If any such deduction or withholding (including but not limited to cross-border withholding taxes) is required on any payment, you will pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount received by us is equal to the amount then due and payable under this Agreement. If your business is classified as tax free, including 503(c) classification in the United States, you may be required to provide us with proof of federal or state tax exemption to avoid our collection of such payments.


      #### **6. Temporary Suspension.**

      #### **9. Proprietary Rights.**


      9.1 Your Content. Except as provided in this Section 9, we obtain no rights under this Agreement from you (or your licensors) to Your Content. You consent to our use of Your Content to provide the Services to you and any End Users, including the data transfer provided for in the Partner sharing agreements you enter into using our Services.

No other entity is entitled to or purports to grant or procure the grant of such license.  You obtain no other rights under this Agreement or such license from Vendia, its affiliates or suppliers to the Services and Vendia Content, including any related intellectual property rights.  Some Vendia Content may be provided to you under a separate license, such as the Apache License, Version 2.0, or other open source license. In the event of a conflict between the license granted by Vendia and any such separate license, such separate license will prevail with respect to the Vendia Content that is the subject of such separate license.

Neither you nor any End User will, or will attempt to (a) reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile the Services or Vendia Content or apply any other process or procedure to derive the source code of any software included in the Services or Vendia Content (except to the extent applicable law doesn’t allow this restriction), (b) access or use the Services or Vendia Content in a way intended to avoid incurring fees or exceeding usage limits or quotas, or (c) resell the Services or Vendia Content. You will not misrepresent or embellish the relationship between us and you (including by expressing or implying that we support, sponsor, endorse, or contribute to you or your business endeavors). You will not imply any relationship or affiliation between us and you except as expressly permitted by this Agreement.


      9.5 Suggestions. If you provide any Suggestions, we will be entitled to use these without restriction or attribution. You hereby irrevocably assign to us all right, title, and interest in and to the Suggestions and agree to provide us any assistance we require to document, perfect, and maintain our rights in the Suggestions.


      #### **10. Indemnification.**


      10.1 General.

You will reimburse us for reasonable attorneys’ fees, as well as our employees’ and contractors’ time and materials spent responding to any third party subpoena or other compulsory legal order or process associated with third party claims described in (a) through (c) above at our then-current hourly rates.


      10.2 Intellectual Property.


      (a) Subject to the limitations in this Section 10, you will defend Vendia against any third-party claim alleging that any of Your Content infringes or misappropriates that third party’s intellectual property rights, and will pay the amount of any adverse final judgment or settlement.
