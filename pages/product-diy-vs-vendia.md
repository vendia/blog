      # No more DIY roadblocks


      The operational and opportunity costs of building secure data sharing solutions, especially for point-to-point APIs between partners, are staggering.


      Companies have tried various approaches to lower these costs, reduce risks, and improve time to market for IT projects. Creating solutions that can share real-time data across applications, companies, clouds, geographies, and IT stacks is both difficult and costly and, at the same time, incredibly repetitive.
