      # Vendia Share Service Terms

      Last Modified: 13 January 2023.


      These Vendia Share Service Terms incorporate the [Vendia Services Agreement](https://www.vendia.com/legal/services-agreement) (“Agreement”) between you and Vendia and govern your use of our Vendia Share Service Offering (“Vendia Share”). Vendia Share is a data sharing platform provided by Vendia that enables users to connect and share data with internal or external partners across organizations and cloud providers. By using Vendia Share, you are agreeing to the latest version of this Policy, which may be updated from time to time and is available on [www.vendia.com/legal](https://www.vendia.com/legal). If material changes are made to this Policy, we will provide a more prominent notice by sending you an email notification. 


      All references to “we / our / us” shall mean Vendia, Inc. and “you / your” shall mean the individual person or legal entity that is using our Services. Capitalized terms used in these Service Terms without definition have the meanings given such terms in the Vendia Services Agreement. 


      These Service Terms and the Agreement take effect when you click an “I Accept” button or checkbox presented with these terms or, if earlier, when you begin to use any Vendia Share Services (“Effective Date”). You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts (e.g., you are not a minor). If you are entering into these Service Terms and the Agreement for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that entity. 


      If you have entered into a separate written agreement with Vendia that exclusively governs your use of Vendia Share, such agreement takes precedence and these Service Terms and the Agreement do not apply to your use of Vendia Share.


      **1. Plans and Pricing.**


      Vendia Share is offered through a number of different plans with different capabilities, support and pricing as described in the Vendia Share Pricing Schedule available at [www.vendia.com/pricing](https://www.vendia.com/pricing) (and any successor or related locations designated by Vendia) (the “**Vendia Share Pricing Schedule**”) which is incorporated herein. You select your initial plan at the time you register for Vendia Share. You can change your plan through the Vendia Share console.


      **2. Customer Support and Service Level Agreement.**


      Vendia provides customer support and a service level agreement for certain Vendia Share plans pursuant to the Vendia Share Customer Service and Service Level Agreement available as [www.vendia.com/legal/share-service-terms](www.vendia.com/legal/share-service-terms) (and any successor or related locations designated by Vendia) (the “**Vendia Share Customer Service and Service Level Agreement**“).


      **3. Revisions**


      We may revise these Service Terms and/or the Vendia Share Pricing Schedule and the Vendia Share Customer Service and Service Level Agreement at any time and from time to time by giving you at least 30 days prior notice of the effective date of such revisions. Revisions may include without limitation changes to plan terms, fees and charges and payment terms.
