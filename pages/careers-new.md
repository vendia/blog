      ## Our mission


      We help people forge deeper, more valuable, and lasting connections through better sharing — across teams, departments, and business networks.


      Every day, we pursue our mission by building and evolving a world-class SaaS platform that makes real-time, cross-cloud, multi-party data sharing highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and secure.


      We deliver on that mission as a community of kind humans who value and behave with trust, ingenuity, a growth mindset, responsibility, and a bias toward results.
